        <p class="resistor">Resistors help control current and voltage. You can also say that resistors resist current. If you take a standard flashlight bulb at 6 volts and connect a 6-volt battery the bulb will glow like it should. But if you connect a 12-volt battery to it the bulb will get too much current and burn out. If you have a flashlight bulb rated at 6 volts and 850ma and you connect a 6-volt battery to the bulb it will work. The bulb has about 7 ohms. But if you connect a 12-volt battery to it the bulb will use 1700 ma which will burn out the bulb. There is not enough resistance in the bulb to prevent too much current. You can fix the problem by adding resistance to the circuit. If you add a 7-ohm resistor, you will have a total of 14 ohms which will allow the right amount of current, and the bulb will glow and not burn out. </p>
        <p class="resistor">Resistors help solve problems of too much current or too much voltage. If you took a voltmeter to the 7-ohm resistor you will find that it also has 6 volts across it. The 6-volt bulb is rated as 6 volts not 12 volts. When you add a 7-ohm resistor to a 12-volt circuit you keep the bulb using only 6 volts like it should. The two resistances function as a voltage divider. The voltage and current of a circuit are related though an equation. The equation is Voltage = current x resistance.</p>
