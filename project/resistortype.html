        <p class="resistortype">What type of resistors are available?
You have resistors of different values like 0 ohms to over 1 billion ohms. 
You have resistors that have a tolerance of 0.0001% to 20%. With a special order you have more options. If you buy a 1000-ohm resistor with a tolerance of 10% you have a resistor that has a resistance of between 900 ohms and 1100 ohms. Resistors are not sold as an exact resistance. You can’t buy a resistor with a resistance of 1000.000000000 ohms. You can get closer to an exact resistance by buying a resistor with a better tolerance like a 0.1% tolerance resistor. But they will be more expensive. A 1000-ohm resistor at 0.1% tolerance will have a resistance between 999 ohms and 1001 ohms.

         <p class="resistortype">Resistors will tend to get hot if a lot of current goes through them. So, resistors can come with different abilities to handle that current. Resistors can come with a power rating like 1 watt or ¼ watt. Some can handle up to 100 watts or more. Some resistors are made in such a way as to not catch fire if they get too hot.
 That 7 ohm resistor we added to the 12 volt circuit would need around a 6 watt resistor.
